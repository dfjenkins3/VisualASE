## What is this database about?

The Myers Lab at Boston University Medical Campus is studying the genetic basis of the
development of Parkinson' disease (PD). This research is based on brain tissue samples
from 11 deceased PD patients and 33 control individuals, the RNA-Seq data, and the
microarray genotyping results. Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the preferred
expression of one allele of a gene in diploid organisms. Multiple alignment methods were
applied to the same data, and Meta-analysis based allele-specific expression detection
(MBASED) was used to identify gene ASE in the RNA-Seq data, and a binomial test was used
to find significant ASE of individual SNPs. In addition to determining the relationship
between ASE and Parkinson's disease as mentioned above, the Myers Lab is also interested
in evaluating and comparing those different alignment methods. This is a user-friendly
web interface for users to visualize the ASE in genes across these PD samples as well as
the gene's statistics, and to compare the different analysis methods with interactive
visualizations.

## What questions can we answer?

1. What genes exhibit ASE? How many instances of ASE occur in genes known to be associated with PD?
2. How much evidence is present to support that a given gene is, or is not, showing significant ASE?
3. For a gene flagged by MBASED as presenting ASE, are the ratios of allele expression similar across all SNPs in that gene?
