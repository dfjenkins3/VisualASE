# VisualASE: A Database Webinterface for Visualizing Allele-Specific Expression in Parkinson’s Disease

## What is this database about? 

The Myers Lab at Boston University Medical Campus is studying the genetic basis of the  development of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This research is based on brain tissue samples from 11 deceased PD patients and 33 control individuals, the RNA-seq data, and the microarray genotyping results. Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the preferred expression of one allele of a gene in diploid organisms. Multiple alignment methods were applied to the same data, and Meta-analysis based allele-specific expression detection (MBASED) was used to identify gene ASE in the RNA-seq data, and a binomial test was used to find significant ASE of individual SNPs. In addition to determining the relationship between ASE and Parkinson’s disease as mentioned above, the Myers Lab is also interested in evaluating and comparing those different alignment methods. This is a user-friendly web interface for users to visualize the ASE in genes across these PD samples as well as the gene’s statistics, and to compare the different analysis methods with interactive visualizations. 

## What questions can we answer?

1. How many instances of ASE exist in a given pathway? What are the genes? How many instances of ASE occur in genes known to be associated with PD? What genes?
2. How much evidence is present to support that a given gene is, or is not, showing significant ASE? 
3. For a gene flagged by MBASED as presenting ASE, what is the distribution of SNPs in that gene? Are the ratios of allele expression similar across all SNPs in that gene?
