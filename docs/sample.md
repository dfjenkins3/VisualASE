* Type: Parkinson’s disease patient or control,
* Sex: male or female,
* Age of death,
* Age of onset: only for Parkinson’s disease patients,
* Had dementia: yes or no.
* Had Alzheimer's disease: yes or no.
* Sequencing batch: the identifier for the batch to which the sample belongs, included for future reference due to the possibility of batch effects.
* Number of RNA-Seq reads: the greater the number of reads, the higher coverage and thus the better the quality of the analysis.
